## JavaScript Timer Application
 >_From Colt Steel's [JavaScript 202 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/learn/lecture/17021540#notes)_

#### This project needs to: 

1. Have a timer that counts down by seconds
    * That timer needs to display the seconds as they count down
    * That timer needs to have a working "pause" and "start" button
    * The numbers need to be editable, so that the user can enter a different number if they like
2. Have an animated border that moves as the timer counts down
    
    _Note: Should I do this is CSS??? Or how???_
